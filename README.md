# CreateJS boilerplate

Use this boilerplate to quickly start a CreateJS project. I suggest pet project rather than commercial (it is not perfect :stuck_out_tongue:).

Unfortunately CreateJS package is legacy so it expose createjs var to window. Maybe some day there will be new version :pray: .

## Getting started

### 0. Make sure you have installed node and yarn

### 1. Clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/szymkab/createjs-boilerplate.git my-project`

### 2. Enter you project

`cd my-project`

### 3. Fire setup script (it will remove git files, setup script and initialize new repository)

`yarn setup`

### 4. Install dependencies

`yarn install`

### 5. Start development

`yarn start`
