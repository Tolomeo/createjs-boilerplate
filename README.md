# CreateJS boilerplate

Use this boilerplate to quickly start a [CreateJS](https://createjs.com/) project using Typescript and Webpack.

CreateJS still doesn't support ES modules and is therefore exposed as a global namespace `window.createjs`.

## Built With

- Of course, [CreateJS](https://createjs.com)
