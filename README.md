# CreateJS application starter

This starter allows you to write code in ES6, using babel to transpile. ~~Unfortunately, there is no official CreateJS npm package, so we have to wait for it.~~ Solved with Bower packages.
To get started clone this repository and type:

``
$ npm install
``

and type npm start to start webpack-dev-server:

``
$ npm start
``

To do:
------
+ ~~local createjs framework~~ *waiting for official package* - already done
+ ~~game class~~
+ ~~preloader class~~
+ ~~preload concept~~
+ ~~main menu class~~
