# CreateJS application starter

This starter allows you to write code in ES6, using babel to transpile. Unfortunately, there is no official CreateJS npm package, so we have to wait for it.
To get started clone or fork this repository and type:

``
$ npm install
``

and type npm start to start webpack-dev-server:

``
$ npm start
``

To do:
------
+ ~~local createjs framework~~ *waiting for official package* - already done
+ ~~game class~~
+ ~~preloader class~~
+ ~~preload concept~~
+ ~~main menu class~~
+ description/instruction
+ webpack production/development
